# Getting Started with Javascript

Three Pillars of JS:

- Types/Coercion
- Scope/Closures
- this/Prototypes

Types/Coercion

- Primitive Types
- Converting Types
- Checking Equality

"In Javascript, everything is an object." = False

Primitive types:

- undefined
- string
- number
- boolean
- object
- symbol
- null?
- function?
- array?

In Javascript, variables don't have types, values do.
